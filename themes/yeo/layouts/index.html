    <p>
    I'm doing DevOps and Development consultant services. I have a wide range of experience design and manage infrastructure on AWS or on-premise system. I'm also pretty good at programming, you can check my <a href="//github.com/kureikain">github</a> or resume. I can work and pick up new technologies pretty quick. I also <a href="/blog">write</a> about <a href="/blog">technolgoy</a>.
    </p>

    I can ideally help on any kind of computer-related activity as long as it's interesting. From creating website, building
    infrastrucutre that scale, bring up ideas into an mobile app(I only do iOS). I can design and develop your next project, big or small, end to end, from setting up infrastructure, monitor/logging system to code. Just drop me a line and we can talk about thing together.

    I also maintain a <a href="https://axcoto.com">personal site</a> and a SaaS for <a href="https://noty.im">uptime monitoring</a>.
